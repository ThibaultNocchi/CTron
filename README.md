# CTron

Implementation of Tron-like game with modern AI. It is made by [Hugo Forrat](https://github.com/HugoForrat) and [Thibault Nocchi](https://github.com/ThibaultNocchi) as a project for an AI class at our CS school.

The plan is to make an implementation of the [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search), then maybe try reinforcement learning through [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).

Currently, only the MCTS is implemented.
